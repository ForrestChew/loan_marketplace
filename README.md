# Loan Marketplace
Borrowers can propose loans and lenders can fill them. If a proposal is filled, the lender has the right to sell, for any price in ether, that loan to a third party. The lender also has the option to sell a fractional percent of the loan at any price. At most, one fractional owner of a given loan is allowed, and therefore, in it's current form, this project won't scale. When a third party buys a fraction of a loan, it is entirey possible that the borrower will never know. A borrower will not be notified if their loan has been sold to a third party, however, if they look up their loan, they will be able to find all information. In essence, the borrower is only given the "need to know" information about their loan. If a loan has multiple owners, the smart contract will handle distributing funds correctly to both the fractional buyer, and the original lender.
